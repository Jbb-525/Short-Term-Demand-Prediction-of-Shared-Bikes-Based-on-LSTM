# Short Term Demand Prediction of Shared Bikes Based on LSTM

Cource Project of **“Data Analytics”** (Score: 90)

The course covers the principles and implementation of machine learning models. In the course project, the author observes data and self-learns LSTM models to address specific problems.

## ① Spatio-temporal Data Preprocessing
  1. Constructed site similarity matrix
  2. Implemented site similarity clustering using K-Medoids to alleviate the influence of sparse matrix
  3. Removed outliers

## ② LSTM Model
  1. Constructed the dataset
  2. Implemented LSTM Moel

## ③ Machine Learning Models
  1. KNN, xgboost, GBDT, RandomForest
  2. Implemented decision regression tree from scratch
